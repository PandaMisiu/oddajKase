![Group balance](readme_images/image-10.png)

**Expenses** — all expenses recorded for the group  
![Group expenses](readme_images/image-11.png)

### Marking Payments as Settled

You can mark payments as settled from two places:

- **Dashboard** — click the "Owed to you" or "You owe" card
- **Group details** — go to the **Settle up** tab inside any group

To mark a debt as paid from the Dashboard, click the **"Owed to you"** card. Click **Mark as paid**, then confirm.

![Mark owed to you as paid](readme_images/image-15.png)

The balance updates immediately and the card reflects the new state.

The same flow works in reverse for the **"You owe"** card.

### Adding an Expense

Click **New Expense** in the sidebar to open the expense form.

![Add expense modal](readme_images/image-18.png)

Fill in:

- **Name** — what the expense was for
- **Amount** — total cost
- **Category** — type of expense
- **Group** — which group to assign it to
- **Paid by** — who paid upfront

Then choose how to split:

**Equal split** — divided evenly among participants  
**By amount** — specify exact amounts per person
